# Artefact Formats

The set of formats that are passed by this tool are well defined by this
specification.


## Tool wide Formats

These Rules hold for all Artefact formats supported by the tool except JSON,
where anything is possible.

### FMT_ID: Requirement Identifier

Requirement identifier consist of letters, digits and underscore, specifically
they match the Regular Expression

    [A-Za-z][a-zA-Z0-9_]+[a-zA-Z0-9]

This way they are safe for use in filenames, URLs, markdown, code, allow
partitioning and are double click friendly.

Covers:
*   REQ_FORMATS (Well defined Formats)

Comment:
Discussion in the [README](README.md#requirement-ids)

## Markdown Requirements

This project's preferred format as used in `REQUIREMENTS.md` or this File.

### FMT_MD: Markdown File Format


The artefact is a Markdown file with freely chosen layout.  A Requirement is in
a heading line with requirement ID and title, followed by description and other
attributes.

Covers:
*   REQ_FORMATS: Well defined Formats

Depends:
*   FMT_MD_START
*   FMT_MD_DESC
*   FMT_MD_ATTRIBUTES


### FMT_MD_START: Requirement Start

A Requirement starts with a `#` heading of any level that has the form `ID:
TITLE`.

### FMT_MD_DESC: Description

The paragraphs following the start of the requirement make up the description of
the requirement.

All paragraphs add to the description until:
*   The Start of another Requirement.
*   The start of an Attribute Paragraph
*   A Heading the same level or less. This ends the Requirement.



### FMT_MD_DESC_HEADINGS: Headings in the description are promoted

Headings with a lower level than the starting one, that do not start a nested
requirement are added to the description. Their heading level is promoted by
removing as many leading `#` as the requirement had

### FMT_MD_COV: Coverage Marks

Paragraphs where each line matches `Covers: ID( \([^)]*\))?` (an ID which may or
may not be followed by text in parenthesis) are omitted from the description and
define a coverage of the requirement with ID. If the text in
parenthesis is present, it is matched against the covered requirement's title.


### Example

A Markdown File with the following content:

    # Headline
    ## REQ_ID: Requirement Title
    Description paragraph
    ### Heading in the description
    another Description Paragraph

    Covers: REQ_COV

    ## Headline outside the description

would lead to one Requirement with id `REQ_ID` and title `Requirement Title`
It would cover `REQ_COV` by ID.
The Description would be:

    Description paragraph
    # Heading in the description
    another Description Paragraph


### Markdown Artefact Parsing Options

The following options can be used to configure parsing of markdown artefacts.

#### FMT_MD_OPT_PREFIX: List of Prefixes

A List of strings can be passed, which is used to prevent the parser from
creating unintended requirements from headlines which accidentally have the
right form.

Lines in the markdown file which would start a new requirement, are treated as
normal headings, if the identifier of the would be requirement does not start
with one of the list of prefixes. If the list is empty, no prefix matching is
performed and all matching lines lead to a requirement.

## Markdown

With link to artefact.md#req-id

## Latex

Generated by seperate Tool, using latex config, req state. Generates 1 tex file per artefact so recompiling tex is cheaper.
(attention using include or input, one makes aux files the other recompiles from
scratch)
