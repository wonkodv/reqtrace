        "Comment": "This is only really necessary where the requirement ids are not informative.\nFor example a Requirement with the id `DSG_123` and the title `Delete Everything`\ncould be covered by a line of code like:\n\n    create_temporary_file();    COVERS(DSG_123)\n\nWhich gives little information to the reader. It is not obvious if the\nrequirement has nothing to do with the object that covers it.\n\nBy also providing the title of the requirement, things can get even worse, if\nthe title is wrong as the reader now believes to know which requirement is\nmeant.\n\n    create_temporary_file();    COVERS(DSG_123, \"Create Temporary File\")\n\nThis is is prevented, by checking the tile. The above case would produce\na verification Error. The code would have to be changed like the following for\nthe tool to accept it without warning:\n\n    create_temporary_file();    COVERS(DSG_123, \"Delete Everything\")\n\nAt this point you have defeated the tool, but now a review can easily discover\nthe wrong coverage.\n\n\n",
