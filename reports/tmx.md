## ARCH_CLI: Command Line Interface

Origin: [doc/requirements/ARCHITECTURE.md:26](../doc/requirements/ARCHITECTURE.md?plain=1#L26)


All functionality of the tool is exposed in a simple command line interface.
The CLI is shipped as a statically linked binary.
Other Tools can interface with the CLI to provide caching, lazy parsing of complicated input formats
and generation of complicated output formats

Each Node in the Graph represents a single Artefact. An Edge from Artefact `A`
to Artefact `B` expresses, that one or more Requirements in `B` cover one or
more requirements in `A`.

## DSG_GRAPH_FORKS: Trace Edge Groups

Origin: [doc/requirements/DESIGN.md:236](../doc/requirements/DESIGN.md?plain=1#L236)


The Graph of artefacts has the following properties:

    * Forks
    * Artefacts
*   Edges in the Graph have a direction.
*   Edges always connect an Artefact to a Fork

covered either by code, or by `FMT` Requirements from `FORMATS.md`.
Code an `FORMATS.md` both have an edge to the same Fork below
`DESIGN.md`.
Each Design also has to be covered by a unit test, so unit tests are
below a separate fork below `DESIGN.md`

## DSG_TRACE: Walk the Graph and trace requirements

Origin: [doc/requirements/DESIGN.md:268](../doc/requirements/DESIGN.md?plain=1#L268)


Tracing is performed by inspecting all forks of the graph, recording
tracing information as it is encountered.
After all forks are processed, a final validation pass turns problems
encountered on the way into errors.


    requirements:
    1. Add all requirements of lower artefacts to the internal
        TracedRequirements if the requirement was not seen before.
    2. Add the requirement's `derived` and `covers` references to lists of
        invalid references
    3. if the requirement was new in (1), add the requirement to the list of
        derived requirements
2.  for all upper requirements:
    1.  find lower requirements that match upper's `depends`
    2.  for all lower artefacts, find lower requirements that cover upper
    3. for all coverages found:
        1.  remove them from the list of invalid references
        2.  remove lower from the list of derived requirements
        3.  add lower to `upper.lower[tine]` and vice versa
        4. if covered with title, add an error if the title is not matched
        correctly
    5.  if no coverage was found, add `(upper, fork)` to the list of uncovered
        requirements

not match the title of the covered requirement

### REQ_U: Title of Upper

    An Upper Requirement

    ### REQ_D: Title of Lower

    A Lower Requirement that covers REQ_U with an exactly mathcing title.

    Covers:

## REQ_UNICODE_SAFE: Sane Handling of unicode

Origin: [doc/requirements/REQUIREMENTS.md:54](../doc/requirements/REQUIREMENTS.md?plain=1#L54)


Some Characters can be represented by multiple different sequences of Unicode
Code Points. Also Unicode Encodings like UTF-8 can encode the same Codepoint
as different bytes.

## REQ_UNIQUE_ID_v2: Requirements have a unique Identifier

Origin: [doc/requirements/REQUIREMENTS.md:10](../doc/requirements/REQUIREMENTS.md?plain=1#L10)


Each requirement must be identifiable by a short, unique string.
All unicode symbols typically used as identifiers must be possible,
though parsers may restrict this

## REQ_VAL_COVERAGE: Validate Coverage

Origin: [doc/requirements/REQUIREMENTS.md:126](../doc/requirements/REQUIREMENTS.md?plain=1#L126)


An error is reported for a Coverage claim for which no Requirement exists in the
relevant artefacts.

## REQ_VAL_TITLE: Check matching title

Origin: [doc/requirements/REQUIREMENTS.md:95](../doc/requirements/REQUIREMENTS.md?plain=1#L95)


A Coverage link that is established by requirement ID can be verified by
comparing the requirement's title.



Comment:
This is only really necessary where the requirement ids are not informative.
For example a Requirement with the id `DSG_123` and the title `Delete Everything`
could be covered by a line of code like:

    create_temporary_file();    COVERS(DSG_123)

Which gives little information to the reader. It is not obvious if the
requirement has nothing to do with the object that covers it.

By also providing the title of the requirement, things can get even worse, if
the title is wrong as the reader now believes to know which requirement is
meant.

    create_temporary_file();    COVERS(DSG_123, "Create Temporary File")

This is is prevented, by checking the tile. The above case would produce
a verification Error. The code would have to be changed like the following for
the tool to accept it without warning:

    create_temporary_file();    COVERS(DSG_123, "Delete Everything")

At this point you have defeated the tool, but now a review can easily discover
the wrong coverage.

## UC_CHECK: Check for correct Tracing

Origin: [doc/requirements/REQUIREMENTS.md:165](../doc/requirements/REQUIREMENTS.md?plain=1#L165)


Like `UC_TRACE` but the only output of interest is whether there were tracing errors or not,
for use in CI/CD Pipelines.
